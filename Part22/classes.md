## Class

- A class in terms of OOP is a blueprint for creating objects.
- A class is like a blueprint for creating similar things.
- an object call is known as constructor.


- In ts m there is a convention to use PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase ) for class name. 
- This means that class names should start with a captial letter and each subsequent word in the class name should also begin with captial letter.

### syntax -

```

class ClassName {

    key : value;

    constructor(key : value){

        this.key = key

    }
}

const variable_Name : ClassName = new ClassName(value.. , value..)
