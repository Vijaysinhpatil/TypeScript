# 🌟 My TypeScript Learning Journey  

> “Every expert was once a beginner who refused to give up.”  

Welcome to my **TypeScript Learning Repository** — a collection of simple yet powerful programs that mark the start of my journey into TypeScript and modern JavaScript development.  

This repository is meant for **beginners** who want to understand how TypeScript works from the ground up — compiling `.ts` files, fixing type errors, exploring configurations, and slowly moving toward frameworks like **Next.js** and **React with TypeScript**.

## 🧠 Motivation

> “Don’t aim to be perfect — aim to be a little better than you were yesterday.”  
Learning TypeScript may feel challenging at first, but every error you fix means your logic just leveled up.
