# `Type Alies`

- It is a way to give a name to a specific type or combination of type.
- It allows you to create a custom name for a type , making it easier to reuse and refere the same name in onther part of code.
- It provides better readibility , organization and abstraction of complex types.
- Use semicolon at the time when u define the type of object in the form of key and value pairs.
- At the time of function defination u need to pass an objectName with typeName . `functionName(objName : TypeName)`
- while function Call just the ObjectName.

# `syntax Declaration`
