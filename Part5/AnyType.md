# Any Type 

- ` Any ` is a type annotation in TS.
- It applies for all or working fine with type of variables wheather it may be an integer or string or anthing

# useCases :

- Easy to work with dynamic typed data (formData , jsonData , netWork response , inputs )
- migration from javascript -> easy to migrating an existing code to javascript


# unknown Type

- ` unkown ` is a type-safe counterpart of ` any `
- it represents a value that could be any thing , but you must check its type before using it.
- It forces you to narrow down the type - so you don't accidently perform invalid.
